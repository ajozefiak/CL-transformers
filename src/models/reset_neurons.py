# TODO
# Perhaps move this code to another file

# Create a generic function that resets neurons for ART, CBP, ReDO
# and create another function, or inside the above function, reset the appropriate weights in the Adam optimizer.
# It may make sense to move this into the Transformer factory function in order to deal with arbitrary architectures.

# Then create function/datastructures for ART/ReDO/CBP
