This experiments are being run in response to Scale 111924.

I am running 2 seeds and I am increasing the number of epochs to 50 and back to 100.

These experiments should take about 5 and 10 hours each, respectively. This is the limit to how much I can scale, up to another factor of 2 in terms of computation time.
