- Here we run the experiment where we train on 5120 = 16 * 320 articles per class, for 500 tasks.
- On colab I ran this for 300 tasks, but here I will run for 500 tasks on the cluster to get more data.

- The difference is that in the other experiments for LViT, we only train on 512 = 16*32 articles per class
