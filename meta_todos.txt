- I need to figure out where I have saved all my results, what I have done exactly.
- I need to figure out what each experiment does and what are the configs for.
- I need to do this for my ViT experiments, my Permuted Shakespeare experiments and for my old experiments.

- For my old experiments, I need to log correlates:
- Weight norms, neuron death (2 definitions?), neuron resets, I may be foreggeting something else.

- There's also the theory to work on.

- I need to go back to my CI-ViT experiments and understand the choice of hyperparameters for L2Init. 
- I need to understand the story here.
- Are we using the same hyperparameter for L2Init for both the training and test accuracies?

- I should see what happens if I use other threshold initializations, I could either run a full sweep or just use the optimal choice.
- This I can investigate later since I suppose it should have relatively little impact and my intiial choice is quite reasonable.
- May at the 3 layer ViT I could investigate.
